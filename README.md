# Breast Cancer Diagnostic System

Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn


Developed a breast cancer prediction system using the Wisconsin dataset, achieving 96.5% accuracy after data cleaning
and optimization. Models tested included Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM (Linear & RBF), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
Random Forest, with Random Forest performing best (95.8% accuracy). Hyperparameter tuning improved accuracy to
96.5%, reducing the error rate to 3.5%
